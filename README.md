# üëÄ Overview
Welcome to the [Zama](https://github.com/zama-ai) Bounty and Grant Program! As a cryptography company working on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and other tools that make protecting privacy easy, we're happy to start this <b>experimental</b> program to encourage anyone from the community to help us move the space forward.

# üí∞ Bounty Program
The Zama Bounty Program was started to incentivize the community at large to create FHE applications and solve problems that can make FHE leap 10 years into the future. This is why our bounty program is centered on contribution rather than bugs. In an effort to encourage more people to get familiar with FHE, we are rewarding up to three submissions per bounty. The proposed submissions will be ranked and rewarded based on the quality of the code, and most importantly, the speed performance (note that all our benchmarks are run on Amazon EC2 HPC7A instances).

### Important dates
- **Submission deadline:** May 12th, 2024 at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).
- **Season 5:** February 9th, 2024 -> May 12th, 2024.
- **Season 4 is now over**. Winners have been announced.

# ü§ù Grant Program
At Zama, we belive that FHE will be the solution to major privacy problems, and that it's the only way to make the internet encrypted end-to-end, so people don't have to care about privacy. This is why we launched the Zama grant Program. It aims to support projects and teams building FHE applications using Zama's libraries, that are solving real-world privacy problems, and that will continue being developed and maintain over time.
