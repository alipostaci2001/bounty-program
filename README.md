- A contribution to our documentation

## Expert Bounties
Bounties of €5,000-€50,000 are available to contributors who identify and resolve major issues, or for any significant contribution that will help us move the FHE space forward. These harder bounties are aimed at experienced researchers and developers and can take the form of (but not exclusively):
- A timing attack on one of our cryptographic libraries
- The identification of a major issue or vulnerability
- A significant contribution to one of our libraries

## Moonshot Bounties
