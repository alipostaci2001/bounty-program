# Compare regressors with Concrete-ML
`Tutorial` `Concrete-ML`

## Overview
Comparison of regressors available in Concrete-ML

## Description
Create a tutorial inspired from our https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/tree/release/0.5.x/docs/advanced_examples/ClassifierComparison.ipynb, but which uses all the regressors we have in Concrete-ML. The goal is to show that, in different situations, the different models may behave better or worse. It should be easy to add new regressors when we add new regressors in Concrete-ML.

We expect from you:
- a PR on the public https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml (or a fork of it), with just a few new file, ideally a single Jupyter notebook
- a detailed notebook, written in a pedagogical way, with an emphasis in the new section(s), i.e., what makes this notebook different from other notebooks
